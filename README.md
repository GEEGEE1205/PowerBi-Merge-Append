### Power BI Data Transformation Project: Merge, Append, Pivoting, and Profiling

- **Overview**
  
  This Power BI project showcases a comprehensive range of Power Query transformation techniques used during my training. The file and its processes simulate how raw data from multiple sources can be efficiently combined, reshaped, and prepared for analysis using Power BI Desktop.

- **Tools Used**
  
    - Power BI Desktop
    - Power Query Editor
    - M Language
    - Transform Ribbon Features

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
 
   - Merge Queries:	Combines two or more tables based on a common key (like SQL JOIN). Used when fields are split across tables.
   - Append Queries:	Stacks datasets vertically (like UNION in SQL). Ideal for combining similar data from different time periods or sources.
      
**Data Preview Tools**

   - Data quality : It Shows % of empty or error values.
   - Data Profiling:	Provides summary stats (min, max, count) and 
   - Data distribution: to detect inconsistencies and  distinct Values or entities in a column.
   - Pivoting:It	Turns unique values from a rows into column headers (wide format).
   - Unpivoting:It Converts multiple columns into rows (long format).
   - Transpose: It Flips rows into columns and vice versa. Used for reshaping or when headers are in rows.

**Data Handling Steps**:

  - Import Multiple Tables
  - Loaded several tables simulating different data sources (e.g., monthly reports, regional data)
  - Applied Data Preview Tools
  - Used the Column Quality, Column Distribution, and Column Profile features to assess data completeness,  uniqueness, and value types
  - Merge and Append Queries
  - Merged datasets on common keys (e.g., Customer ID, Product)
  - Appended similar datasets (e.g., Sales_Jan, Sales_Feb) into one unified table
  - Data Transformation Techniques
  - Renamed columns for clarity
  - Removed nulls and errors
  - Changed data types
  - Created new calculated columns where needed
  - Advanced Reshaping
  - Pivoted product types into columns for summary views
  - Transposed data for restructuring when headers were in the wrong place
  - Unpivoted wide-format data into tidy long format for analysis
  
**Visual Output**

-  A clean data table was created, ready for analysis. The report demonstrates mastery of preprocessing steps critical to Power BI success.

**Learnings & Outcomes**

   - Merging and appending taught me data integration skills
   - Data profiling helped me identify hidden data issues
   - Pivoting and unpivoting taught me how data shape impacts analysis
   - Transposition proved essential for restructuring wrongly-formatted inputs
